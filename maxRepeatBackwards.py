"""
We represent each cell, containing a F value, G value, X coordinate, Y coordinate, and Parent's coordinate, as a 5 value tuple.
The starting cell and all examined neighbor cells are pushed into the OPEN list.
When our agent visits a cell, that cell will be added into the CLOSED set.
Neighbors explored will also be added into the CLOSED set to avoid backtracking.
That cell's coordinate key will also be used to added its parent's value into a PATH dictionary. PATH will keep track of the correct pathing from start to goal. 

H is the heuristic function used. In this case the Manhattan distance.
G values are calculated for each cell in the open list as its manhattan distance relative to the agent's current location.
F values is calculated by each cell manhattan distance relative to the goal.

TIEBREAKING is done using minimal value of G. By documentation of Heapq, tiebreaking is implemented when using tuples. For tiebreaking by using maximal value of G, see MaxAStar.py
